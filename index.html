                    <p>If you don’t know what to do in the gym or you’ve never stepped foot in one before, it can seem like
                        a pretty scary place. What are all the machines for? How do I do use them? Is everyone looking at
                        me?</p>
    
                    <p> That’s why we’ve put together the ultimate gym guide for beginners, that covers everything from what
                        to pack in your gym bag, right up to your very own beginner’s workout. Once you’ve read through this
                        guide, you’ll know everything there is to know about working out in the gym and smashing your
                        fitness goals.</p>
                    <h2>BEFORE YOU START</h2>
                    <h3>HEALTH REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    <img class="img2" src="/img/t3.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>The gym is designed to give everyone the tools they need to reach their dream fitness goals. Whether
                        it’s to tone up or build strength, anyone is welcome to train in the gym, but before starting your
                        fitness journey, you may be asked to disclose any medical conditions. This helps personal trainers
                        to tailor a routine that suits you.</p>
    
                    <p> Here are a few examples that you may be asked to disclose:</p>
    
                    <li> Any existing heart conditions</li>
                    <div>
                        <li>Ongoing medical conditions like diabetes</li>
                    </div>
                    <li> Any major operations you’ve had in the last 12 months</li>
                    <li> Whether a doctor has advised you to abstain from exercise in the past</li>
    
                    <h3>GYM INDUCTIONS</h3>
                    <p> A gym induction is a brief tour of the gym’s facilities. It covers gym etiquette (which can vary
                        between clubs), how to use the machines, and how you can access each area of the gym.</p>
    
                    <p> A good induction is key to getting you started on the right foot. The staff that run inductions will
                        always have tips and advice that could save you a lot of hassle later on, like the best times to use
                        what equipment and what exercises are great for beginners.</p>
    
                    <p> Check out our in-depth guide on how you can get the best induction possible for a great head start.
                    </p>
    
                    <h2> PREPARING FOR YOUR FIRST VISIT</h2>
                    <h3> THE BEST TIME TO GO TO THE GYM</h3>
                    <p> One question every new-starter asks is “what’s the best time to go to the gym?”</p>
    
                    <p> Morning is often hailed as the best time to fit in a workout, as it can reduce stress levels and</p>
                    leave you energized for the rest of the day. However, it all depends on your ‘circadian rhythm.’</p>
                    <img class="img2" src="/img/t4.jpg" alt="">
                    <p> A circadian rhythm is your internal clock, the one that causes you to fluctuate between alert and
                        sluggish throughout the day. If you consider yourself a morning person, it should be easy to
                        motivate
                        yourself for an hour in the gym before work. But, if you can’t get anything done before your 9 am
                        coffee, don’t beat yourself up about it — hit the gym on your way home instead.</p>
    
                    <p> There really is no ‘best time’ to exercise, it all depends on your body, so listen to it and hit the
                        gym
                        when it’s most convenient for you.</p>
    
                    <h2> WORKING TO YOUR SCHEDULE</h2>
    
                    <p> If your schedule is getting in the way of your circadian rhythm, it can help to get an extra hour of
                        sleep every night. You feel the pressure of your circadian rhythm more when you’re tired, so getting
                        to
                        bed earlier might be the push you need to crush those 7am laps in the pool!</p>
    
                    <h2>DODGING PEAK TIMES</h2>
    
                    <p> The other factor to consider when scheduling your session is when the gym is likely to be busy. If
                        you’re looking for space when working on your strength, it is worth considering avoiding peak times.
                        This is usually just before or after the working day, although on-site staff will be able to advise
                        you
                        further.</p>
    
                    <h2>WHAT TO WEAR AND TAKE WITH YOU</h2>
                    <p> If you’re truly looking to power through your session and achieve your peak performance, you’ll want
                        to
                        come prepared.</p>
    
                    <p> Here’s a list of gym bag essentials:</p>
    
                    <li> Gym-appropriate training gear (avoid denim or replica shirts)</li>
                    <li> Gym shoes (sturdy trainers work best; avoid weak canvas shoes)</li>
                    <li>Sweat towel (for wiping down equipment after you use it)</li>
                    <li>Towel and shampoo (for a post-workout shower)</li>
                    <li>Post-workout snack</li>
                    <li>Water bottle</li>
                    <h2>WARMING UP</h2>
                    <p>If you’re feeling self-conscious on your first gym visit, your initial instinct might be to skip
                        straight to the treadmill or weight machine and ‘prove your worth,’ but this is a rookie mistake.
                        One of
                        the most important parts of a good workout is to properly warm up.</p>
    
                    <p> Warm-ups are crucial as they prepare your body for the demands of exercise, loosening up the muscles
                        and
                        reducing the risk of injury. This also means you’re less likely to pull a muscle during your workout
                        and
                        minimizes the chances of lactic acid building-up, which can lead to cramping.</p>
    
    
                    <h2>YOUR FIRST GYM SESSION</h2>
                    <h3>WHERE TO START</h3>
                    <p>Once you’re warmed up and fully prepared, it’s time to train. But where do you begin? If you’re
                        unsure of how to start at the gym, we’ve got you covered.</p>
    
                    <p> workouts aren’t improvised: they’re meticulously planned ahead of time. Those people who seem
                        to glide from treadmill to tricep press are actually following a well-kept schedule, tailor-made to
                        get the most out of each session.</p>
    
                    <p> So what’s the secret to mapping out a workout that works for you? It’s understanding what each piece
                        of gym equipment is designed to do — and how it can help you reach your goals</p>
    
                    <h2>GYM MACHINES EXPLAINED</h2>
    
                    <img class="img2" src="/img/t5.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Your induction should include a brief ‘how-to’ for each machine. If there’s one that was missed out
                        and you want to use it, don’t try to figure it out on your own: ask a staff member to show you how
                        to use it properly.</p>
    
                    <p>Using a machine incorrectly can damage the equipment or in extreme circumstances can lead to injury
                        — not a great way to start your time at the gym.</p>
    
                    <p>Here’s a quick breakdown of some machines you can expect to find in most gyms:</p>
    
                    <h3>SECTION 1: CARDIO MACHINES</h3>
    
                    <h4>BEST FOR: Losing weight; strengthening your heart and lungs.</h4>
    
                    <li> TREADMILL — A running machine that can provide a great workout to improve your cardiovascular
                        strength. You can adjust incline and pace depending on what type of workout you’re looking for.</li>
                    <li> ELLIPTICAL CROSS TRAINER — A dual-action trainer that works both your upper and lower body in
                        tandem. Provides a low-impact way of exercising your hamstrings, quads, glutes, chest, back, triceps
                        and biceps.</li>
                    <li> ROWING MACHINE — Simulates the movements of a rower’s body, swapping the water and oars for a
                        handle
                        and chain. A fantastic full-body workout that puts emphasis on your core and melts away fat.</li>
                    <li> EXERCISE BIKE — A sit-down cardio machine that works all of your leg muscles. You can increase
                        resistance to strengthen and tone your legs.</li>

                        your joints but still works every muscle in your legs.</li>
                    <h3>SECTION 2: RESISTANCE AREA</h3>

                    <li>CHEST PRESS — Simulates a barbell or dual-dumbbell press in a more controlled environment. Sitting
                        at a 45-degree incline is a great way to engage your upper chest muscles without feeling
                        overwhelmed.</li>
                    <li>CHIN-UP MACHINE — Designed to help you become stronger simply by using your own bodyweight.

                    <li> BICEP CURL — A machine that isolates a workout to just your biceps.Good for toning or developing
                        muscle in your upper arms.</li>
                    <li> TRICEP PRESS — Works your triceps, along with your shoulders and lateral muscles, as you push down
                        to lift a weight behind you.</li>
                    <li>CABLE MACHINE — Can be used in multiple ways to work triceps, biceps, chest and more. Doesn’t follow
                        a rigid movement like other machines so it works more of your muscle fibres, which is better for
                        building strength.</li>
                    <li> LEG PRESS — Builds muscle and tones your legs by making you push with your feet against a selected
                        weight. Targets your quads, hamstrings and glutes — perfect for shaping up that behind!</li>
                    <h3>SECTION 3: FLEXIBLE SPACE</h3>
    
                    <h4>BEST FOR: Conditioning; targeted stretching; rehabilitation; functional training; freestyle group

                        conditioning and rehabilitation exercises.</li>

                        to
                        tone up and build core strength.</li>
                    <li> WEIGHTED SLED — A piece of equipment you can add weights to and push or pull to develop your
                        strength. Great for sports conditioning.</li>
